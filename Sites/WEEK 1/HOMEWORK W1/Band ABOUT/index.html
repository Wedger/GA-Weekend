				Bastille are a band from South London, comprising of four members and melodies that swoop and soar interchangeably between them on stage. </p>
				<p>
				Yet this has not always been the case, as until fairly recently Bastille was merely a moniker for Dan Smith, himself a singer-songwriter who used to write these beautifully composed intricacies in his bedroom and perform alone. </p>
				<p>
				But Bastille has grown, and as well as expanding in terms of size, the rippling melodies and tunes that flow through all Bastille's songs show a renewed confidence and maturity, a change that has seen the band go from strength to strength this year alone.
